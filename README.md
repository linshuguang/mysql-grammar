# Mysql Parser Implementation

Here I'm trying to implement a full-fledged SQL parser, based on Positive Technologies MySQL grammar
[https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/mysql]( https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/mysql).

In the future, this parser will be serving as a general-purpose mysql front-end to any system that needs an interface to hide the  internal mechanism.
